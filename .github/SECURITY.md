## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in the **protocol specification** or in **documentation** that could lead to misuse (e.g., spoofing, privacy leaks), please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive findings.
2. Open a **private security advisory**: [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/thomaszta/aap-protocol/security/advisories/new).
3. Or email the maintainers if you prefer (see repository profile).

We will acknowledge your report and work on a fix or clarification. For protocol-level issues we may publish an errata or patch version and credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep AAP and its implementations safe.
